## Summary

QuizzerLand is a gamified educational app leveraging the open data project of the Swiss government. 
The core features of our app consists of questions about both past metrics and future projections of sustainability topics such as water availability, energy consumption and urban head islands. 
Correct answers gives the user points which translates into GreenCoin, a currency that can be used in the app to either 1) purchase sustainable products (e.g., local markets), or 2) donate to non-profit organizations engaged with sustainability causes. 

## Inspiration

The two most common life-crisis we all face is getting older and climate change. 
Working with a team of user researchers, we helped discover the sensibilities of each generation. 
After a further study into the applications they are using, we tried to find similarities in their usage behaviors and habits. 
This led us to creating a unique game based mobile application that is fast paced, challenging and fun. 
And yes, that is more than just a mobile app!

## What it does

The main objective of our app is to bring more awareness to the population, specially young people who did not have enough time to witness how rapidly our planet is changing due to sustainability related topics.	

## How we built it

A mobile app was built that leverages on unconscious learning by gamifying content and making it more fun. User research was conducted to determine the commonalities of the elderly and younger generations when using apps. A game-based approach was chosen so that the youngster can learn with fun while the older people get familiarized with mobile apps and applications developed for them. Users are rewarded by completing tasks in the game, which triggers their brain to start processing information better, faster, and more efficiently.

## Challangues we ran into

The open data is a valuable but also challenging resource to work with. 
Considering the limited amount of time, doing proper statistical analysis to derive valuable facts from the data was the main challenge of our project.Â 
However, we build the app such that it can easily be extended to cover more questions, facts and analysis in the future.
